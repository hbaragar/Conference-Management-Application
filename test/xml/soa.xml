SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) is switching from hype to mainstream, which means that we are going to have real-worl expereinces with establishing and running SOA in practice. 
In this tutorial, Nicolai Josuttis will separate the SOA hype from reality. As a team leader of the realization of a SOA at a world-wide mobile phone company with a heterogeneous infrastructure, about 30 service participants, and about 300 services in production, he knows about the big difference between was is being said and promised about SOA and what it means in practice to run a SOA in a large and heterogeneous environment. Starting with a short clarification of the fundamental SOA concepts, he will present the most important steps and traps of bringing SOA into production. 
Facts and knowledge based on a broad understanding of large and distributed systems spiced with important insights based on his experience. Note that this tutorial covers the concepts and isn't just a tutorial about Web-Services (although there is a lot to say about Web-Services as a preferred SOA implementation strategy).        </abstract>
